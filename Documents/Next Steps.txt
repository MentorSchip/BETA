Opening screen -> Tap to open bottle -> Scroll opens & bottle floats away -> Login (-> Role Select) 
- Student: Island scene view, bottle nearby, arrow hovering over
	* What is the background, Skybox or camera feed?
	-> Tap (raycast) bottle -> Scroll animation -> Short display of image to find 
	-> Scroll disappears (where does it go?), Image moves to Hint Panel.


Next Milestone:
- Extend Back functionality (Mentor & Student paths) to revert data to earlier state
- Map View: enter from Game area
- Animation on selecting bottle in Game Area
	+ Screen fade on transition to/from Game Area
	-> Replace background with overlay image, fade out transparency
- Send email with data automatically
* Remember to turn off Reporter object on future demo builds!

Errors:	
[check] Complete student path, create new student -> resumes first student progress (at end)
	- Check if error also present when closing/reopening app
- "Saving..." event does not work on mentor path (fine for student) -> feature currently disabled

Minor Errors:
- "Saving..." notification not always present, Console Errors re inactive
- Scroll background shows up behind dropdown (should be invisible)
- In Student Path: scroll still present if left while answering questions
	- Hack Fix: Set Student SO "Contains Animated" to true 
	-> Scroll always leaves when entering game (but usually gone by bottle click)

Refactor:
- ScavengerHunt: break into smaller classes with single responsibilities
- Mentor: break into smaller classes with single responsibilities

Future Development (post demo)
- [Research] Store images in JSON? -> store images created by mentors
